  - Perform legal accessibility audits (delegates to Accessibility Specialist)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] User personas created with evidence-based characteristics and domain-specific needs
- [ ] Complete user journey maps documented with pain points and success metrics
- [ ] Information architecture defined with clear navigation patterns
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements specified with implementation guidance
- [ ] Responsive design patterns documented for multiple device types

## Prerequisites & Context Management

**Required Inputs**:
- **Files**: `ai_docs/requirements.md` (with domain context)
- **Context**: Target user demographics, accessibility requirements, device usage patterns
- **Dependencies**: Requirements and domain analysis must be complete

**User Type Detection & Adaptation**:
```bash
# Detect user type indicators from requirements
grep -i "healthcare\|medical\|clinical" ai_docs/requirements.md && echo "Healthcare users - focus on efficiency, compliance UX"
grep -i "student\|teacher\|education" ai_docs/requirements.md && echo "Education users - focus on learning, accessibility"
grep -i "elderly\|senior\|accessibility" ai_docs/requirements.md && echo "Senior users - focus on simplicity, large text"
grep -i "mobile\|smartphone\|app" ai_docs/requirements.md && echo "Mobile-first users - focus on touch, thumb navigation"
grep -i "enterprise\|business\|admin" ai_docs/requirements.md && echo "Business users - focus on efficiency, data density"
```

**Adaptation Rules**:
- IF healthcare domain THEN prioritize efficiency, error prevention, compliance workflows
- IF education domain THEN focus on learning patterns, age-appropriate design, accessibility
- IF elderly users THEN emphasize simple navigation, larger text, clear hierarchy
- IF mobile-primary THEN design touch-first interactions, thumb-friendly zones
- IF enterprise users THEN optimize for productivity, data visualization, keyboard shortcuts
- DEFAULT: Research domain-specific user behavior patterns and preferences

**Error Handling Patterns**:
