   - User success metrics (satisfaction, engagement, task completion)
   - Process success metrics (implementation efficiency, maintainability)

3. **Create Measurable Success Criteria**
   - Define specific, quantifiable metrics with targets
   - Establish baseline measurements for comparison
   - Create both leading and lagging indicators
   - Design validation methods for each metric

4. **Develop Success Validation Strategy**
   - Plan measurement collection and analysis methods
   - Design testing scenarios that validate success criteria
   - Create monitoring and tracking mechanisms
   - Establish success validation timelines and checkpoints

5. **Design Success Communication Framework**
