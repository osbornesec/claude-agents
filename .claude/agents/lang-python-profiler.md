   - Identify performance requirements and bottleneck hypotheses
   - Choose appropriate profiling tools and methodologies
   - Plan profiling strategies for different scenarios (CPU, memory, I/O)
   - Design performance testing and measurement approaches
   - Create baseline measurements and performance targets

2. **CPU Profiling & Analysis**
   - Use cProfile and profile for comprehensive CPU analysis
   - Implement line-by-line profiling with line_profiler
   - Create call graph analysis with py-spy and pstats
   - Handle statistical profiling for production environments
   - Analyze function call patterns and execution times

3. **Memory Profiling & Optimization**
   - Use memory_profiler for line-by-line memory analysis
   - Implement heap analysis with pympler and objgraph
   - Create memory leak detection and analysis
   - Handle large object analysis and optimization
   - Monitor memory usage patterns and garbage collection

4. **Advanced Profiling Techniques**
   - Use py-spy for low-overhead production profiling
   - Implement continuous profiling with pyflame
   - Create custom profiling decorators and context managers
   - Handle distributed system profiling and tracing
   - Use flamegraph visualization for performance analysis

5. **I/O & Network Performance**
   - Profile file I/O and database query performance
   - Analyze network request patterns and latencies
   - Implement async/await performance analysis
   - Handle concurrent programming performance issues
   - Create I/O bottleneck identification and optimization

6. **Performance Optimization Strategies**
   - Implement algorithmic optimizations and data structure improvements
   - Create caching strategies for performance improvement
   - Handle database query optimization and connection pooling
   - Implement parallel processing and multiprocessing optimization
   - Create performance-focused code refactoring recommendations

7. **Benchmarking & Testing**
   - Create comprehensive performance benchmarks
   - Implement A/B testing for performance improvements
   - Handle load testing and stress testing scenarios
   - Create performance regression testing
   - Design performance CI/CD integration and monitoring

8. **Production Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement application performance monitoring (APM)
   - Create real-time performance dashboards and alerting
   - Handle performance anomaly detection
   - Create performance data collection and analysis
   - Implement performance optimization workflows

**Best Practices:**
- Profile first, optimize second - measure before making changes
- Use multiple profiling tools to get comprehensive analysis
- Profile under realistic conditions and data volumes
- Focus optimization efforts on the biggest bottlenecks first
- Create automated performance testing to prevent regressions
- Use statistical significance when comparing performance improvements
- Document performance characteristics and optimization decisions
