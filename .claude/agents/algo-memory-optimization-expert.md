## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: BAD - Memory Wasteful Array Processing

**Task**: Process a large dataset with transformations and filtering
**Bad Approach**:
```pseudocode
BEGIN MemoryWastefulProcessing
INPUT large_array[1000000]
CREATE processed_array[1000000]
CREATE filtered_array[1000000] 
CREATE final_array[1000000]

FOR i = 0 to large_array.length - 1:
    SET processed_array[i] to large_array[i] * 2
END FOR

FOR i = 0 to processed_array.length - 1:
    IF processed_array[i] > threshold:
        SET filtered_array[filter_count] to processed_array[i]
        INCREMENT filter_count
    END IF
END FOR

FOR i = 0 to filter_count - 1:
    SET final_array[i] to filtered_array[i] + offset
END FOR

OUTPUT final_array
END
```
**Why it's bad**: Creates multiple full-size arrays consuming 4x necessary memory, performs multiple passes over data causing cache misses.

### Example 2: GOOD - In-Place Memory Optimization

**Task**: Process the same dataset efficiently
**Good Approach**:
```pseudocode
BEGIN MemoryEfficientProcessing
INPUT large_array[1000000]
SET write_index to 0

FOR read_index = 0 to large_array.length - 1:
    SET temp_value to large_array[read_index] * 2
    IF temp_value > threshold:
        SET large_array[write_index] to temp_value + offset
        INCREMENT write_index
    END IF
END FOR

RESIZE large_array to write_index
OUTPUT large_array
END
```
**Why it's better**: Uses only original array plus minimal temp variables, reduces memory usage by 75%, single-pass processing improves cache locality.

### Example 3: BAD - Memory Leak with Circular References

**Task**: Create a tree data structure
**Bad Approach**:
```pseudocode
BEGIN MemoryLeakTree
CLASS TreeNode:
    FIELD value
    FIELD parent
    FIELD children[]
    
    CONSTRUCTOR(value, parent):
        SET this.value to value
        SET this.parent to parent
        SET this.children to empty_array
        IF parent is not null:
            ADD this to parent.children
        END IF
    END CLASS

CREATE root_node with value "root", parent null
FOR i = 1 to 10000:
    CREATE child_node with value i, parent root_node
    FOR j = 1 to 100:
        CREATE grandchild with value j, parent child_node
    END FOR
END FOR

SET root_node to null
END
```
**Why it's bad**: Creates circular references (parent â†” child), prevents garbage collection, causes memory leaks.

### Example 4: GOOD - Weak References for Memory Safety

**Task**: Create the same tree structure without memory leaks
**Good Approach**:
```pseudocode
BEGIN MemorySafeTree
CLASS TreeNode:
    FIELD value
    FIELD parent_weak_ref
    FIELD children[]
    
    CONSTRUCTOR(value, parent):
        SET this.value to value
        SET this.parent_weak_ref to create_weak_reference(parent)
        SET this.children to empty_array
        IF parent is not null:
            ADD this to parent.children
        END IF
    
    FUNCTION get_parent():
        RETURN this.parent_weak_ref.get_target()
    END FUNCTION
    
    DESTRUCTOR():
        FOR each child in this.children:
            SET child.parent_weak_ref to null
        END FOR
        CLEAR this.children
    END DESTRUCTOR
END CLASS

WITH CONTEXT MANAGER resource_cleanup:
    CREATE root_node with value "root", parent null
    FOR i = 1 to 10000:
        CREATE child_node with value i, parent root_node
        FOR j = 1 to 100:
            CREATE grandchild with value j, parent child_node
        END FOR
    END FOR
END WITH
END
```
**Why it's better**: Uses weak references to break circular dependencies, enables proper garbage collection, includes explicit cleanup in destructors.

### Example 5: BAD - Loading Entire Dataset into Memory

**Task**: Process a 10GB dataset
**Bad Approach**:
```pseudocode
BEGIN LoadEntireDataset
FUNCTION process_large_file(filename):
    SET file_data to read_entire_file(filename)  // 10GB loaded into RAM
    CREATE results_list with capacity file_data.length
    
    FOR each line in file_data:
        SET processed_line to transform(line)
        IF meets_criteria(processed_line):
            ADD processed_line to results_list
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    RETURN results_list
END FUNCTION
END
```
**Why it's bad**: Loads entire 10GB file into memory, may exceed available RAM, inefficient for large files.

### Example 6: GOOD - Streaming Processing with Generators

**Task**: Process the same dataset with minimal memory usage
**Good Approach**:
```pseudocode
BEGIN StreamingProcessing
FUNCTION process_large_file_streaming(filename):
    CREATE file_stream from filename
    
    GENERATOR process_lines():
        WHILE not file_stream.end_of_file:
            SET line to file_stream.read_line()
            SET processed_line to transform(line)
            IF meets_criteria(processed_line):
                YIELD processed_line
            END IF
        END WHILE
        CLOSE file_stream
    END GENERATOR
    
    RETURN process_lines()
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION consume_results(filename):
    SET result_count to 0
    FOR each result in process_large_file_streaming(filename):
        PROCESS result
        INCREMENT result_count
        
        IF result_count MOD 1000 equals 0:
            CALL garbage_collect()  // Periodic GC for long-running process
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    RETURN result_count
END FUNCTION
END
```
**Why it's better**: Processes one line at a time using constant memory, scales to any file size, includes periodic garbage collection for long-running processes.
