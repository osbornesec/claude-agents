## Physical Data Model

### Database Schema Design

#### Core Tables

##### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'suspended')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Rationale: UUID for global uniqueness, email verification for security,
-- status enum for user lifecycle management, timezone-aware timestamps
```

##### Orders Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    order_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' 
        CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled')),
    currency VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD',
    subtotal DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
    tax_amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    shipping_amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unpaid'
        CHECK (payment_status IN ('unpaid', 'paid', 'refunded', 'partially_refunded')),
    shipping_address JSONB,
    billing_address JSONB,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    shipped_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    delivered_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Rationale: RESTRICT on user deletion to preserve order history,
-- JSONB for flexible address storage, separate payment tracking
```

[Continue with additional core tables...]

#### Audit and Compliance Tables

```sql
-- Generic audit trail for all table changes
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    table_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    record_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE')),
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    changed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT
);

-- Rationale: Generic audit table reduces schema complexity,
-- JSONB allows flexible storage of changed values
```

### Design Decisions Documentation

#### Primary Key Strategy
**Decision**: Use UUIDs for all primary keys
**Rationale**: 
- **Global Uniqueness**: Enables distributed system integration
- **Security**: Non-predictable IDs prevent enumeration attacks
- **Merge-Friendly**: Simplifies data synchronization between environments
- **Trade-off**: Slightly larger storage and index overhead vs. auto-increment integers

#### Data Type Selections
| Data Type | Use Case | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| UUID | Primary/Foreign Keys | Global uniqueness, security, distributed systems |
| VARCHAR vs TEXT | String Storage | VARCHAR for constrained fields, TEXT for unlimited content |
| DECIMAL | Monetary Values | Exact precision required for financial calculations |
| JSONB | Semi-structured Data | Flexible storage with indexing and query capabilities |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE | Temporal Data | Timezone awareness for global applications |

#### Normalization Strategy
**Normalization Level**: 3NF with selective denormalization
**Rationale**: 
- **3NF Benefits**: Eliminates data redundancy, ensures data integrity
- **Selective Denormalization**: 
  - Order totals stored redundantly for performance
  - User full names derived but cached for display performance
  - Product categories denormalized in search indexes

#### Constraint Strategy
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Enabled for data integrity with appropriate CASCADE/RESTRICT rules
- **Check Constraints**: Used for status enums and business rule validation
- **Unique Constraints**: Applied to natural business keys (email, order_number)
- **Not Null Constraints**: Applied to required business fields

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Indexing Strategy

#### Primary Indexes
```sql
-- Users table indexes
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_status_created ON users(status, created_at) WHERE status = 'active';
CREATE INDEX idx_users_last_login ON users(last_login_at) WHERE last_login_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Orders table indexes
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_orders_number ON orders(order_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_status ON orders(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_created ON orders(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_date ON orders(created_at) WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'delivered');

-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date_range ON orders(user_id, created_at) 
    WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled');
```

#### Index Rationale
| Index | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| idx_users_email | Authentication | Login queries by email |
| idx_orders_user_status | User dashboard | User's orders by status |
| idx_orders_status_created | Admin reporting | Orders by status and date range |
| idx_orders_created_date | Analytics | Time-based order analysis |

#### Partial Indexes
- Used for large tables where only subset of data is frequently queried
- Reduces index size and maintenance overhead
- Examples: Active users only, Non-cancelled orders only

### Query Optimization Patterns

#### Common Query Patterns

##### User Dashboard Query
```sql
-- Optimized user dashboard with order summary
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(o.id) FILTER (WHERE o.status != 'cancelled') as active_orders,
    COUNT(o.id) FILTER (WHERE o.status = 'delivered') as completed_orders,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount) FILTER (WHERE o.status = 'delivered'), 0) as total_spent,
    MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.status = 'active'
GROUP BY u.id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email;

-- Uses: idx_users_status_created, idx_orders_user_status
-- Performance: O(log n) for user lookup, O(k) for order aggregation per user
```

##### Product Search Query
```sql
-- Optimized product search with pagination
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.price,
    p.image_url,
    c.name as category_name,
    AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating,
    COUNT(r.id) as review_count
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
WHERE 
    p.status = 'active'
    AND ($1 IS NULL OR p.name ILIKE '%' || $1 || '%')
    AND ($2 IS NULL OR p.category_id = $2)
    AND p.price BETWEEN COALESCE($3, 0) AND COALESCE($4, 999999)
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.description, p.price, p.image_url, c.name
HAVING ($5 IS NULL OR AVG(r.rating) >= $5)
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN $6 = 'name' THEN p.name END ASC,
    CASE WHEN $6 = 'price_asc' THEN p.price END ASC,
    CASE WHEN $6 = 'price_desc' THEN p.price END DESC,
    CASE WHEN $6 = 'rating' THEN AVG(r.rating) END DESC,
    p.created_at DESC
LIMIT $7 OFFSET $8;

-- Uses parameterized queries for security and performance
```

#### Query Performance Guidelines
- **Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: Always analyze query execution plans
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection and improve plan caching
- **Appropriate JOINs**: Use INNER vs LEFT JOIN based on data requirements
- **LIMIT with OFFSET**: Consider cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Aggregate Optimization**: Use partial indexes and materialized views for heavy aggregations

### Caching Integration Points

#### Application-Level Caching
- **User Sessions**: Cache user authentication and profile data
- **Product Catalog**: Cache product listings and search results
- **Shopping Carts**: Cache cart contents in Redis
- **Static Reference Data**: Cache categories, configurations

#### Database-Level Caching
- **Query Result Caching**: Enable query plan caching
- **Connection Pooling**: Configure optimal pool sizes
- **Materialized Views**: For complex analytical queries

## Scalability Architecture

### Vertical Scaling Strategy
- **CPU Optimization**: Optimize queries and indexing for CPU efficiency
- **Memory Optimization**: Configure buffer pools and caching for available RAM
- **Storage Optimization**: Use appropriate storage types (SSD for OLTP workloads)
- **Connection Management**: Optimize connection pooling and statement caching

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

#### Read Replicas
```sql
-- Read replica configuration strategy
-- Master: Write operations and real-time reads
-- Replica 1: Reporting and analytics queries
-- Replica 2: Search and catalog browsing
-- Replica 3: Background jobs and data processing
```

**Read Replica Guidelines**:
- **Read-Heavy Queries**: Route to replicas (product searches, reports)
- **Write-After-Read**: Route to master to avoid replication lag issues
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute read load across multiple replicas
- **Monitoring**: Track replication lag and failover capabilities

#### Partitioning Strategy

##### Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)
- **Orders Table**: Partition by user_id hash for even distribution
- **Audit Log**: Partition by date ranges for efficient archival
- **Reviews**: Partition by product_id for product-specific queries

```sql
-- Example: Orders table partitioning by user_id hash
CREATE TABLE orders_shard_0 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 0);
CREATE TABLE orders_shard_1 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 1);
CREATE TABLE orders_shard_2 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);
CREATE TABLE orders_shard_3 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);
```

##### Vertical Partitioning
- **User Profile Data**: Separate frequently accessed from rarely accessed columns
- **Product Details**: Basic info vs. detailed specifications
- **Order Information**: Core order data vs. fulfillment details

#### Database Sharding Considerations
- **Shard Key Selection**: Choose keys that distribute data evenly
- **Cross-Shard Queries**: Minimize queries spanning multiple shards
- **Resharding Strategy**: Plan for future shard rebalancing
- **Referential Integrity**: Handle foreign keys across shards

## Data Migration and Evolution Strategy

### Schema Version Control

#### Migration Framework
```sql
-- Migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE schema_migrations (
    version VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    applied_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    execution_time_ms INTEGER,
    checksum VARCHAR(64)
);

-- Example migration file: 20240315_001_add_user_preferences.sql
-- Migration: Add user preferences table
BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    preference_key VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    preference_value JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, preference_key)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_preferences_user ON user_preferences(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_preferences_key ON user_preferences(preference_key);

INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version, description, applied_by)
VALUES ('20240315_001', 'Add user preferences table', CURRENT_USER);

COMMIT;
```

#### Migration Best Practices
- **Atomic Migrations**: Each migration runs in a single transaction
- **Rollback Scripts**: Every migration has a corresponding rollback
- **Non-Destructive Changes**: Avoid dropping columns in production migrations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure application code works during migrations
- **Testing**: Test migrations on production-like data volumes

### Data Seeding Strategy

#### Reference Data
```sql
-- Seed script for categories
INSERT INTO categories (id, name, slug, description, sort_order) VALUES
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Electronics', 'electronics', 'Electronic devices and accessories', 1),
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Clothing', 'clothing', 'Apparel and fashion items', 2),
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Books', 'books', 'Books and educational materials', 3)
ON CONFLICT (slug) DO NOTHING;
```

#### Test Data Generation
- **Development Environment**: Generate realistic test data volumes
- **Performance Testing**: Create datasets matching production scale
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Curated data for business scenarios

### Production Deployment Procedures

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Migration scripts tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance impact assessed for large tables
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for new schema elements
- [ ] Application code deployed and tested with new schema

#### Deployment Process
1. **Maintenance Window**: Schedule during low-traffic periods
2. **Backup Creation**: Full database backup before migration
3. **Migration Execution**: Run migrations with monitoring
4. **Verification**: Validate schema changes and data integrity
5. **Application Deployment**: Deploy compatible application code
6. **Monitoring**: Watch for performance issues and errors
7. **Rollback Plan**: Ready to execute if issues arise

## Data Integrity and Consistency

### Consistency Model
**Approach**: Strong consistency for financial data, eventual consistency for non-critical data

#### Strong Consistency Requirements
- **Financial Transactions**: Order totals, payment processing, refunds
- **Inventory Management**: Stock levels, reservation systems
- **User Authentication**: Login credentials, permissions
- **Audit Data**: Compliance and regulatory tracking

#### Eventual Consistency Acceptable
- **Search Indexes**: Product catalog search updates
- **Analytics Data**: Reporting and dashboard metrics
- **Recommendation Data**: User preference learning
- **Cache Invalidation**: Application-level caching

### Data Validation Framework

#### Database-Level Constraints
```sql
-- Example: Order validation constraints
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT check_positive_amounts 
    CHECK (subtotal >= 0 AND tax_amount >= 0 AND shipping_amount >= 0 AND total_amount >= 0);

ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT check_total_calculation
    CHECK (total_amount = subtotal + tax_amount + shipping_amount);

ALTER TABLE order_items ADD CONSTRAINT check_positive_quantity
    CHECK (quantity > 0 AND unit_price >= 0);
```

#### Application-Level Validation
- **Business Rules**: Complex validation logic in application layer
- **Cross-Entity Validation**: Rules spanning multiple tables
- **Temporal Validation**: Date/time business rules
- **External System Validation**: Payment processing, address verification

### Backup and Recovery Strategy

#### Backup Schedule
- **Full Backups**: Daily during low-traffic hours
- **Incremental Backups**: Every 4 hours during business hours
- **Transaction Log Backups**: Every 15 minutes for point-in-time recovery
- **Cross-Region Replication**: For disaster recovery

#### Recovery Procedures
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to specific timestamp
- **Table-Level Recovery**: Restore individual tables from backups
- **Disaster Recovery**: Failover to different geographic region
- **Testing**: Monthly recovery testing with non-production data

## NoSQL Integration (if applicable)

### Document Database Design (MongoDB)

#### Document Schema Examples
```javascript
// Product catalog document
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  sku: "PROD-12345",
  name: "Wireless Headphones",
  description: "High-quality wireless headphones...",
  category: {
    id: "electronics",
    name: "Electronics",
    path: "/electronics/audio"
  },
  pricing: {
    currency: "USD",
    price: 199.99,
    sale_price: null,
    cost: 89.50
  },
  inventory: {
    available: 45,
    reserved: 3,
    reorder_level: 10
  },
  attributes: {
    color: ["Black", "White", "Blue"],
    brand: "AudioTech",
    wireless: true,
    battery_life: "20 hours"
  },
  images: [
    {
      url: "https://cdn.example.com/prod-12345-1.jpg",
      alt: "Front view of wireless headphones",
      primary: true
    }
  ],
  seo: {
    title: "AudioTech Wireless Headphones - 20hr Battery",
    description: "Premium wireless headphones with...",
    keywords: ["wireless", "headphones", "bluetooth"]
  },
  created_at: ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"),
  updated_at: ISODate("2024-01-20T14:22:00Z")
}
```

#### Index Strategy for MongoDB
```javascript
// Product collection indexes
db.products.createIndex({ "sku": 1 }, { unique: true })
db.products.createIndex({ "category.id": 1, "pricing.price": 1 })
db.products.createIndex({ "attributes.brand": 1, "category.id": 1 })
db.products.createIndex({ "name": "text", "description": "text" })
db.products.createIndex({ "created_at": -1 })
```

### Cache Database Design (Redis)

#### Caching Patterns
```redis
# User session cache
SET session:uuid:12345 "{\"user_id\":\"user-456\",\"email\":\"user@example.com\"}" EX 3600

# Shopping cart cache
HSET cart:user-456 product-123 2
HSET cart:user-456 product-789 1
EXPIRE cart:user-456 86400

# Product cache with tags
SET product:123 "{\"name\":\"Product Name\",\"price\":29.99}" EX 3600
SADD product_tags:electronics product:123
SADD product_tags:featured product:123
```

### Search Engine Design (Elasticsearch)

#### Index Mapping
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard",
        "fields": {
          "keyword": {
            "type": "keyword"
          }
        }
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard"
      },
      "category": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "price": {
        "type": "float"
      },
      "tags": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "created_at": {
        "type": "date"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Self-Critique Process

After completing your work, perform a critical self-assessment and create
`ai_docs/self-critique/database-specialist.md` with the following analysis:

### Critical Self-Assessment Framework

**1. Data Modeling Quality**
- Did I correctly identify all business entities and their relationships?
- Were my normalization decisions appropriate for the use cases?
- Did I properly consider data integrity and consistency requirements?
- Did I miss any important entity attributes or relationships?

**2. Performance Optimization**
- Were my indexing strategies aligned with the expected query patterns?
- Did I consider both read and write performance optimization?
- Were my scalability recommendations realistic and implementable?
- Did I properly address high-volume and high-concurrency scenarios?

**3. Technology Selection and Integration**
- Was my database technology selection well-justified based on requirements?
- Did I properly consider integration with the overall system architecture?
- Were my NoSQL integration patterns (if applicable) well-designed?
- Did I consider operational complexity and team expertise in my recommendations?

**4. Migration and Evolution Strategy**
- Did I create a practical and safe migration strategy?
- Were my rollback procedures comprehensive and tested?
- Did I consider the impact of schema changes on running applications?
- Were my versioning and deployment strategies realistic for the team?

**5. Research Quality and Best Practices**
- Were my context7 and perplexity queries specific and productive for database research?
- Did I incorporate current database design best practices and patterns?
- Did I research performance optimization techniques specific to the chosen technology?
- Were my design decisions based on solid database engineering principles?
