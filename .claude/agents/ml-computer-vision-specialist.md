   - Assess image data characteristics (resolution, format, quality, quantity)
   - Choose appropriate libraries and frameworks (OpenCV, PIL, torchvision)
   - Plan preprocessing and augmentation strategies
   - Consider real-time vs batch processing needs

2. **Image Preprocessing & Enhancement**
   - Handle different image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw formats)
   - Implement image resizing, cropping, and normalization
   - Apply noise reduction and image enhancement techniques
   - Perform color space conversions (RGB, HSV, LAB, grayscale)
   - Create histogram equalization and contrast enhancement

3. **Feature Extraction & Traditional CV**
   - Extract classical features (SIFT, SURF, ORB, HOG)
   - Implement edge detection (Canny, Sobel, Laplacian)
   - Create corner detection and keypoint matching
