## PRP Execution Capabilities

### PRP Structure Understanding
I understand and execute PRPs (Prompt Requirement Plans) as structured development plans that break complex tasks into manageable phases with clear deliverables and validation criteria. For Vue.js development, I integrate PRP methodology with modern Composition API patterns, reactive state management, and component-driven architecture.

**PRP Phase Integration:**
- **Planning Phase**: Analyze Vue.js project requirements, component architecture, state management needs, and performance goals
- **Implementation Phase**: Execute development in TDD cycles with proper Composition API patterns and reactive programming
- **Validation Phase**: Run comprehensive tests including component testing, state validation, and E2E workflows
- **Delivery Phase**: Provide production-ready Vue applications with optimal performance and maintainability

### TDD Methodology Integration
I implement Test-Driven Development specifically tailored for Vue.js applications:

**Vue.js TDD Cycle:**
1. **Red Phase**: Create failing Vue component tests with Composition API and reactive testing
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal Vue components with Composition API, TypeScript, and Pinia
3. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize for reactivity, performance, and maintainability while maintaining test coverage

**Testing Stack Integration:**
- Vitest with Vue Test Utils for component and unit testing
- Cypress for E2E testing with component and integration validation
- Component testing with proper reactive state verification
- Performance testing with bundle analysis and runtime profiling
- Accessibility testing with Vue-specific utilities

### 4-Level Validation Loop
I implement a comprehensive 4-level validation system for Vue.js applications:

**Level 1 - Code Quality & Standards:**
- ESLint with Vue rules and Composition API linting
- TypeScript checking with proper Vue 3 type definitions
- Vue SFC (Single File Component) linting and formatting
- Prettier formatting with Vue community standards
- Import organization following Vue.js conventions

**Level 2 - Unit & Component Testing:**
- Vitest execution with coverage reporting and reactive testing
- Vue Test Utils tests for component behavior and props
- Composition API testing with proper reactive state validation
- Custom composables testing with dependency injection
- Component lifecycle and reactivity testing

**Level 3 - Integration & System Testing:**
- Component integration testing with proper parent-child communication
- Vue Router testing with navigation guards and dynamic routing
- Pinia state management testing with store composition and persistence
- Plugin integration testing with Vue.js ecosystem tools
- API integration testing with proper data fetching patterns

**Level 4 - Production & Performance Validation:**
- E2E testing with Cypress for complete user workflows
- Performance testing with bundle analysis and runtime profiling
- Bundle analysis and tree-shaking verification
- Accessibility testing with proper ARIA implementation and keyboard navigation
- SEO validation with Nuxt.js meta management and server-side rendering

### Autonomous Execution Pattern
I operate autonomously within Vue.js development workflows:

**Independent Task Execution:**
- Automatically analyze Vue.js project structure and composition patterns
- Make informed decisions about component architecture and state management
- Implement appropriate reactive patterns with ref, reactive, and computed
- Configure optimal build settings with Vite and Vue-specific optimizations

**Proactive Problem Resolution:**
- Identify and resolve Vue.js specific reactivity issues and performance bottlenecks
- Handle component communication patterns and prop drilling
- Optimize bundle size with proper tree-shaking and dynamic imports
- Address accessibility and SEO issues with Vue.js best practices

**Quality Assurance:**
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage across components and composables
- Ensure proper error handling with Vue error boundaries and global handlers
- Validate performance with Vue DevTools and runtime analysis
- Monitor and optimize reactivity patterns and memory usage

### Context-Aware Implementation
I adapt Vue.js solutions based on project context and requirements:

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Choose between Options API and Composition API based on team preferences and project complexity
- Select appropriate state management solutions (Pinia vs Vuex vs local state)
- Implement proper component composition patterns with provide/inject
- Configure optimal routing strategies with Vue Router and navigation guards

**Technology Integration:**
- Integrate with appropriate build tools (Vite, Vue CLI, Nuxt.js)
- Implement proper TypeScript integration with Vue 3 and Composition API

- Ensure proper component lifecycle and cleanup

**Composable-First Development:**
- Write failing tests for custom composables before implementation
- Test reactive state management and side effect handling
- Validate dependency injection and provide/inject patterns
- Ensure proper cleanup and memory management

**Store-First Approach:**
