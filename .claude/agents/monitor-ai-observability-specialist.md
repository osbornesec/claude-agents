**Technology Stack Detection & Adaptation**:
```bash
# Detect AI/ML frameworks and observability tools
ls requirements.txt package.json | xargs grep -l "openai\|anthropic\|langchain\|llamaindex" 2>/dev/null
# Check for observability platforms
grep -r "prometheus\|grafana\|datadog\|new.relic\|honeycomb" . 2>/dev/null || echo "observability platform detection needed"
# Identify conversation/log formats
find . -name "*.jsonl" -o -name "*.log" | head -5
# Check for vector databases for semantic search
grep -r "pinecone\|weaviate\|qdrant\|chroma\|faiss" . 2>/dev/null || echo "vector database detection needed"
```
